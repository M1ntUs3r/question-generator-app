# 📘 Mint Maths Question Generator

**Mint Maths** is a web app that generates random National 5 Maths past exam questions for practice.  

Users can filter by year, topic, or paper (calculator/non-calculator), and instantly download a custom PDF containing both the selected questions and their corresponding solutions.


I am currently working on adding Higher and Advanced Higher to this.
